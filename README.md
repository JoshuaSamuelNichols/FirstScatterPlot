## Project Description
This is a Python script designed for beginners to easily understand the basics of creating scatter plots using popular Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The script generates a simple scatter plot, showcasing the relationship between two normally distributed variables.

## Features
- **Data Generation**: Utilizes Numpy to create sample data sets with normal distributions.
- **Data Handling**: Employs Pandas to organize data into a structured format, making visualization straightforward.
- **Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib to plot the data and display the scatter plot with labels and a grid for enhanced readability.

## Prerequisites
Before running this script, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip if you don't already have them:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

```
